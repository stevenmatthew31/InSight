## Backgrounder
VISION is one of the most important aspect in life. But, not everyone can use their vision as well, one of them is blind people. So, we propose a smartphone application to help the blind people in navigating directions and detecting nearby objects. This application will help them to reach their desired destination with the guide directions from this application. This app will tell the user which direction they have to take to reach their destination. In addition, this application will also detect objects around the user, for example, there are other people in front of them or other objects.
Currently, the available technology is to connect volunteers with visual impairments to help identify objects in their surroundings. The technology they use does not automatically detect objects around the user and direct them to the desired destination.

## Intro of our capstone project 
We want to help people with visual impairments by creating another way so that they can see clearly again with our apps as the eyes, so create the apps with the main feature is the object detection with the text to speech so user will know if there is any obstacle in front of them by voice.

## Target Market
People who have special needs for vision (Blur or Loss of vision)
